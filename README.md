# Impractical_Python_Projects
Errata:
Page 79: code output at bottom of page is based on Figure 4-3, not Figure 4-2.

Page 85: In Listing 4-9, the code at wingding 5 and the following line that read:
    row1 = (message[:row_1_len])
    row2 = (message[row_1_len:])
Should instead read:
    row1 = (message[:row_1_len]).lower()
    row2 = (message[row_1_len:]).lower()
    
Also in Listing 4-9, the code immediately below wingding 8 that reads:
        plaintext.append(r1.lower())
        plaintext.append(r2.lower())
Should instead read:
        plaintext.append(r1)
        plaintext.append(r2)
        
Page 100: The output printout near the bottom of page that reads:
Panel at east end of chapel slides
Should instead read:
Panelateastendofchapelslides

Page 103: The cipher example that reads:
The cold tea didn’t please the old finicky woman.
Should instead read:
So, the cold tea didn’t please the old finicky woman.

Page 141: Wingding 7 and the preceding line in Listing 7-10 that read:
lock_wheel = int(randrange(0, len(combo)))
next_try[lock_wheel] = randint(0, len(combo)-1)
Should instead read:
lock_wheel = randrange(0, len(combo))
next_try[lock_wheel] = randint(0, 9)

Page 205: The line and following equation that read:
The transformation to generate points over a unit disc is as follows:
x= √r*cos
Should instead read as:
The transformation to generate points evenly over a unit disc is:
x= √r*cosθ

And the line that reads:
The equations yield (x, y) values between 0 and 1.
Should instead read as:
The equations yield (x, y) values between -1 and 1.

Page 218: Indentation for the listing on the page should be as follows:
>>> from random import randint

>>> trials = 100000

>>> success = 0

>>> for trial in range(trials):

           faces = set()
           
           for rolls in range(6):
           
               roll = randint(1, 6)
               
               faces.add(roll)
               
           if len(faces) == 6:
           
               success += 1
               
>>> print("probability of success = {}".format(success/trials))
probability of success = 0.01528

Page 252: The last line on page that reads:
Set the default to 'sbc_blend', since this is theoretically the most stable mix of the four choices.
Should instead read as:
Set the default to 'bonds', in order to see how this supposedly “safe” choice performs.

Page 259: The first line in last paragraph that reads:
Let’s work an example that assumes a starting value of $2,000,000, a “safe and secure” bond portfolio, a 4 percent withdrawal rate (equal to $80,000 per year), a 30-year retirement, and 50,000 cases.
Should instead read as:
Let’s work an example that assumes a starting value of $2,000,000, a “safe and secure” bond portfolio, a 4 percent withdrawal rate (equal to $80,000 per year), a 29-30-31 retirement range, and 50,000 cases.

Page 261: The last two lines in Listing 12-9 that read:
    investments -= withdraw_infl_adj
          investments = int(investments * (1 + i))          
Should instead read as:
