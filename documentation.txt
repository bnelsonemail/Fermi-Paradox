# ********************* OBJECTIVE *************************

# For a given number of advanced galactic civilizations and an average radio bubble size, estimate the probability of any civilization detecting the radio transmissions of any other civilization.  For perspective, post the size of Earth's curent radio bubble on a 2D graphical representation of the Milky Way.



# ****************** STRATEGY *******************

# 1.    Estimate the number of transmitting civilizations using the Drake equation.
# 2.    Choose a size range for their radio bubbles.
# 3.    Generate a formula for estimating the probability of one civilization detecting another.
# 4.    Build a graphical model of the galaxy and post Earth's radio emissions bubble.


# *********** DRAKES EQUATION ****************

# N = R^* f(p) n(e) f(l) f(i) f(c) L

#       N =     The number of civilizations in or galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable
#       R^* =   The avg rate of star formation in the galaxy (new stars per year)
#       f(p) =  The fraction of stars with planets
#       n(e) =  For stars with planets, the avg number of planets with an enveironment suitable for life
#       f(l) =  The fraction of planets that develop life
#       f(i) =  The fraction of life-bearing planets with intelligent, civilized life
#       f(c) =  The fraction of civilizations that release detectable signs of their existence into space
#       L =     The length of time -- in years -- over which the civilizations release the detectable signals

#       ** Recent studies have indicated that n(e) is in between 10% and 40% of all planets may be suitable for SOME FORM of life.
